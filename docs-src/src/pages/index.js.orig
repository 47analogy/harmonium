    <h1>Possum</h1>
    <p>
      Possum is a framework of React components optimized for teams that want to
      ship apps fast. It is a curated list of components that work together and
      have cohesive styles. One of our design goals is that you never have to
      research and handpick component packages. Whatever you need is already here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possum was built by Revelry Labs. We've been doing React since the earliest
      version was in beta. We've built dozens of React apps and we've learned what
      works and what doesn't. And our focus is on shipping gold fast. So we never
      want to solve the same problem twice.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <pre>
      <code>
        npm install --save awesome-possum
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      You can now import the components and start using them. See the component
      example documentation listed to the left.
    </p>
    <h2>SCSS</h2>
    <p>
      We don't just provide JavaScript. We've built a set of SCSS styles for all
      the components. It is in the <code>scss</code> directory of the package. You
      can either copy it into your project's SCSS directory, or use a tool like{' '}
       <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sassy-npm-importer">sassy-npm-importer</a>{' '}
       to import it from the package.
